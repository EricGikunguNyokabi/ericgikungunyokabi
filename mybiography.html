			<h1>Biography of Eric Gikungu Nyokabi</h1>
			<br>
				<p>
				

					Eric Gikungu Nyokabi was born on August 22nd, 1996, in a village called Rwathia, Kenya. He was raised as the only child of his parents, Samuel Kariuki and Florence Nyokabi. Unfortunately, tragedy struck at an early age when Eric's father passed away in April 1998. Following the loss of his father, Eric's mother took on the responsibility of raising and nurturing him, and they moved to Eric's maternal grandparents' home in Kayu village.

					In 2001, Eric embarked on his educational journey by joining nursery school. The following year, in 2002, he enrolled in class 1 at Kayu Primary School. Throughout his primary education, Eric displayed exceptional academic performance, culminating in his achievement as the third highest scorer in the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) exams at his school in 2009.

					Eager to continue his education, Eric transitioned to Nyagatugu Boys Secondary School in 2010. He continued to excel academically and obtained a B plain (64 points) in his final secondary school exams, known as the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE). His impressive results earned him a four-year government sponsorship to study at Machakos University, where he pursued a Bachelor of Science degree in Statistics and Programming.

					Eric completed his degree requirements in December 2017, but due to administrative processes, he officially graduated on November 30th, 2018, with Second Class Honours. Shortly after completing his studies, Eric secured his first job at CloudFactory Kenya, where he worked from July to November. However, his employment at CloudFactory was cut short when an opportunity arose for him to travel abroad to Qatar for better prospects.

					Unfortunately, Eric encountered challenges with the agency responsible for arranging his travel, Jawatha Agencies. The agency swindled him out of Ksh. 150,000, but he managed to secure a partial refund of Ksh. 50,000 in October 2019.

					Despite the setbacks faced in his professional endeavors, Eric remains determined and resilient. He continues to strive for success and growth, leveraging his skills in statistics and programming to pursue a rewarding career and make a positive impact in the world.
